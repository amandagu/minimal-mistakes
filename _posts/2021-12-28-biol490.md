<i>This is blog post is a summary of research that I did under the supervision of <a href="https://www.pedersenfisherieslab.com/">Dr. Eric Pedersen</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/paglia/home?authuser=0">Dr. Simone Brugiapaglia</a> in 2020 as part of research course. Their guidance and kindness in such wild times was invaluable, and without them, this project would not exist. If you're interested, the full report can be found <a href ="/assets/pdfs/AmandaGuBiol490Fall2020.pdf">here</a>.</i>
