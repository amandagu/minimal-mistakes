<i>This blog post is a summary of research that I did under the supervision of 
  <a href="https://www.pedersenfisherieslab.com/">Dr. Eric Pedersen</a> and 
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/paglia/home?authuser=0">Dr. Simone Brugiapaglia</a> 
  in 2020 as part of research course. Their guidance and kindness in such wild times was 
  invaluable, and without them, this project would not exist. If you're interested, the 
  full report can be found <a href ="/assets/pdfs/AmandaGuBiol490Fall2020.pdf">here</a>. 
  This summary is intended to be (hopefully) readable to people with no background in ecology, 
  some familiarity with mathematics, and a general scientific literacy, ie. all my non-math 
  friends who keep asking what I actually do.</i>

<h3>Compressive Sensing 101</h3>
Compressive sensing (also known as compressed sensing) is a method used to solve sparse, 
underdetermined matrix systems which was developped around 2004. Let's unpack that sentence
with an example.
$$
\begin{align*}
2x + y &= 5\\
2x + y + z &=8
\end{align*}
$$
In this system of equations, we have 3 unknowns and 2 equations, so the system is 
<i>underdetermined</i>: there are more unknowns than equations. This poses a problem for 
traditional solving techniques because, as you might recall, you at least the same number 
of independent equations as you have variables. In this case, we can quickly check that this 
is indeed true. We obtain a <i>family</i> of solutions, or a set of multiple solutions. We 
know that $z=3$, but any combination of $x, y$ works, so long as $2x +y = 5$. Another way of 
stating this is that any point on the line $y=-2x+5$ solves the system. If this system was all the 
information we had, we'd be at a standstill. However, we have one more condition: sparsity. 
All sparsity says is that a significant number of the variables have a value of zero. How many? 
No idea. Which ones? We don't know. Unfortunately, there's not even a definition of exactly 
what proportion of the variables need to be zero for a system to be sparse. Even still, with 
this condition of sparsity, we can solve this underdetermined matrix system<sup>(1)</sup>. 
Just as a refresher, the above system can be written in the following way using matrices.
$$
\begin{matrix}
2 & 1 & 0\\
2 & 1 & 1
\end{matrix}
\times 	
\begin{matrix}
x\\
y\\
z
\end{matrix}
=
\begin{matrix}
5\\
8
\end{matrix}
$$

This technique has a lot of uses outside of ecology. As you can imagine, the idea of recovering 
the more information with fewer equations or samples has obvious applications in information 
theory: the science of how we store, compress, and restore information.

(1) The keen ones of you out there might say: but wait, we could just solve this equation by 
hand now that we know that $x$ or $y$ is $0$, and you're right, it's quite trivial in this 
toy example. However, less trivial when you're working with hundreds of variables, and you 
have no idea which ones or how many are zero. The example is merely to illustrate the technique and 
unfortunately isn't a perfect showcase of the power of compressive sensing. Bear with me, 
it gets more exciting soon.
