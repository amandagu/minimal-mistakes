<i>This blog post is a summary of research that I did under the supervision of 
  <a href="https://www.pedersenfisherieslab.com/">Dr. Eric Pedersen</a> and 
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/paglia/home?authuser=0">Dr. Simone Brugiapaglia</a> 
  in 2020 as part of research course. Their guidance and kindness in such wild times was 
  invaluable, and without them, this project would not exist. If you're interested, the 
  full report can be found <a href ="/assets/pdfs/AmandaGuBiol490Fall2020.pdf">here</a>. 
  This summary is intended to be (hopefully) readable to people with no background in ecology, 
  some familiarity with mathematics, and a general scientific literacy, ie. all my non-math 
  friends who keep asking what I actually do.</i>

<h3>Compressive Sensing 101</h3>
Compressive sensing (also known as compressed sensing) is a method used to solve sparse, 
underdetermined matrix systems which was developped around 2004. Let's unpack that sentence
with an example.
$$
\begin{align*}
2x + y &= 5\\
2x + y + z &=8
\end{align*}
$$
In this system of equations, we have 3 unknowns and 2 equations, so the system is 
<i>underdetermined</i>: there are more unknowns than equations. This poses a problem for 
traditional solving techniques because, as you might recall, you at least the same number 
of independent equations as you have variables. In this case, we can quickly check that this 
is indeed true. We obtain a <i>family</i> of solutions, or a set of multiple solutions. We 
know that $ z=3 $, but any combination of $ x, y $ works, so long as $ 2x +y = 5 $. Another way of 
stating this is that any point on the line $ y=-2x+5 $ solves the system. If this system was all the 
information we had, we'd be at a standstill. However, we have one more condition: sparsity. 
All sparsity says is that a significant number of the variables have a value of zero. How many? 
No idea. Which ones? We don't know. Even still, with 
this condition of sparsity, we can solve this underdetermined matrix system<sup>(1)</sup>. 
Just as a refresher, the above system can be written in the following way using matrices.
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
2 & 1 & 0\\
2 & 1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\times 	
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y\\
z
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
5\\
8
\end{pmatrix}
$$
So how do we (or a computer) pick a sparse solution from the <i>sample space</i> of possible 
solutions? For that, we turn to measure theory. Measure theory is a branch of mathematics 
that concerns itself with ways we can measure real things and mathematical objects, 
the properties of measures, and why all of that matters in the first place. Say you're handed a 
box and given the instructions "measure it". A very reasonable first question would be how? Do you 
want the volume? The height? The surface area? The mass? We'd pick a <i>measure</i> depending 
on why we want to measure the box. If we're trying to paint it, we'd pick surface area. 
If we want to see if it would fit under my bed, we'd pick height, etc. 
<br>
<br>
Just as we can measure real things, like a box, in different ways, we can also measure a solution to 
our system. Recall that any point on the line $ y=-2x+5 $ is a solution, so when I say 
a solution, I mean a point on that line such as $(2, 1)$ or $(-1, 7)$. Now, if we wanted to 
"measure" the point $(2, 1)$ we could use the sum of the absolute values of the $x$ and $y$ variables to obtain a value 
of $2+1=3$. This method is called the $\ell_1$ norm <sup>(2)</sup>. We could also measure it by its 
distance to the origin, or the Euclidean norm, by taking $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{4+1}=\sqrt{5}$. 
This way of measuring is called the $\ell_2$ norm.
Now, like two different boxes might have the same value by a given measure (like the same volume), 
but be different sizes, different points also can have the same value under a given norm. 
For example, $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, $(0.75,-0.25)$, and $(-0.5, -0.5)$ all have the same $\ell_1$ norm.

Figure 1: The unit ball of the $\ell_1$ (in red) and $\ell_2$ norms (in blue). The unit "ball" 
is all the points that have a value of 1 for a given norm. Yes, it is called a unit ball even 
when it is very pointy.
<br>
<br>
In the $\ell_1$ norm, all of the points with the same value make a diamond shape, and in the 
$\ell_2$ norm, all of the points with the same value make a circle (both of which are centred 
at 0), as we can see in the image above.
<br>
<br>
Now, why we took that digression into measure theory is because of the way compressive sensing 
chooses one answer from a whole sample space of answers. The final answer given is the answer 
in the sample space with <i>the smallest </i>$\ell_1$<i> norm</i>.

This technique has a lot of uses outside of ecology. As you can imagine, the idea of recovering 
the more information with fewer equations or samples has obvious applications in information 
theory: the science of how we store, compress, and restore information.

(1) The keen ones of you out there might say: but wait, we could just solve this equation by 
hand now that we know that $ x $ or $ y $ is $ 0 $, and you're right, it's quite trivial in this 
toy example. However, less trivial when you're working with hundreds of variables, and you 
have no idea which ones or how many are zero. The example is merely to illustrate the technique and 
unfortunately isn't a perfect showcase of the power of compressive sensing. Bear with me, 
it gets more exciting soon.

(2) I've skipped over a lot of (all of) the nuance of norms and measures. They are different. 
Forgive me analysis gods.
