<i>This is blog post is a summary of research that I did under the supervision of 
  <a href="https://www.pedersenfisherieslab.com/">Dr. Eric Pedersen</a> and 
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/paglia/home?authuser=0">Dr. Simone Brugiapaglia</a> 
  in 2020 as part of research course. Their guidance and kindness in such wild times was 
  invaluable, and without them, this project would not exist. If you're interested, the 
  full report can be found <a href ="/assets/pdfs/AmandaGuBiol490Fall2020.pdf">here</a>. 
  This summary is intended to be (hopefully) readable to people with no background in ecology, 
  some familiarity with mathematics, and a general scientific literacy, ie. all my non-math 
  friends who keep asking what I actually do.</i>

<h3>Compressive Sensing 101</h3>
Compressive sensing (also known as compressed sensing) is a method used to solve sparse, 
underdetermined matrix systems which was developped around 2004. Let's unpack that sentence
with an example.
