<strong>Heyo! Nice to meet ya.</strong> My name's Amanda Gu.
<br>
<br>I graduated from McGill University in with a B.A. in Maths and a minor in Computer Science. I just got back from taking a year off from the academic and corporate worlds - saw some neat places and did some cool things. Currently, I'm working remotely from Whistler, in beautiful British Colombia, so if you're around, drop me a line! Things I enjoy include: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0VppVwRA8kXs1JEkSoutAY">making playlists</a>, quantitative ecology (my main research interest), <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9595225-amanda">reading</a>, and being outside.
<br>
<br>I will try my best to keep this as up-to-date as possible with where I am and some travel pics, but no promises.
<br>-Manderz
